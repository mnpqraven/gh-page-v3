# Learning Rust
I've decided to open up a [repo](https://github.com/mnpqraven/rust-dump) with
the purpose being a storage of rust programs I'm writing whilst I'm learning
the program. I've decided to start with writing small CLI programs, both to
learn the language and to also eventually use said programs as I'm doing all my
work day to day on the CLI.

To be blunt I've been struggling so far, there's a lot to cover and I still
hasn't gotten a clear understanding of some of Rust's core features like
Traits, Result, Option. I did manage to unravel a bit of the ownership after
a few coding sessions so I think at least I'm making progress.

The program I'm working on right now is a IP fetcher that writes into
mountpoint in `systemd`. I have a Synology NAS at home and to connect to it
remotely with `systemd`, using a hostname like `yoururl.synology.me` has been
working for me until recently that it just refuses to accept hostname and
only accept ip addresses. Now comes a new problem that surfaces: the public
ip is dynamic and will change every once in a while. Hence I'm writing a
script that fetches the public ip from my hostname automatically and then
writes into the mountpoint before mounting the drive, that should technically
alleviate the issue I'm facing.
