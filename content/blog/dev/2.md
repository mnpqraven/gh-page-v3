# Dynamic Route

Took me a long time to get the simple blog route. Haven't done anything like this so it feels really weird to me at first but I think I'm slowly getting it

The `ContentDoc` component grab the content file, that much is simple. But to get the parameters of the dynamic content file(`[...slug]` files) we need to use `useRoute` and access the parameters with `params.slug`

```
const route = useRoute()
const slug = route.params.slug
```

`slug` should now give us the param of the file, in this case the route path. We can pipe this into `useAsyncData` to have a dynamic api call grabbing the metadatas .e.g `publishedAt`
