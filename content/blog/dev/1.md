# Getting back to Nuxt3

Getting used to new work took more time than I expected, also to be fair I also spent a lot of time fixing my dotfile config. I was getting caught up with the new neovim's built-in LSP and all that new lua plugins

Now to get to some Nuxt. I'll try to record my development from here on so I'll try to get a blog route up and running

I've gotta say Nuxt3 is really comfy on the auto routing feature. All I've done so far is create this `markdown` file and create a new route in the navbar and Nuxt already automatically routes to the post. Now what I need to do is making a button to be to traverse to the previous posts
