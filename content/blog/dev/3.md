# Slow weekend
I originally planned to spend this weekend on polishing the content area and fix
the glaring navigation bug but at the end I spent the whole weekend lazing
around and chill, mostly reading mangas and light novels. On the bright side it's not like there's a deadline to this
project and I feel like I got a lot of energy back after these 2 days. For
today's changes there's not much, just a small directory refactor so I can make
a new content group easier later down the line.
